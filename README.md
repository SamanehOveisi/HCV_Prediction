HCV Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project designed to predict Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) conditions using machine learning models. The primary focus is to classify patients into various medical categories using data analysis, feature selection, and predictive modelling.
----------------------------------

Project Features: 
Random Forest Classifier:
Used for initial predictions and performance evaluation.
Employs cross-validation to measure accuracy and reliability.
Logistic Regression with Feature Selection:
Balances the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Selects optimal features using Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV).
Ensemble Learning:
Combines predictions from Random Forest and Logistic Regression using an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm.
Visualization:
Visualizes class distribution, accuracy across folds, confusion matrices, and more.
---------------------------------
Requirements:
To run the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
imblearn
matplotlib
seaborn
openpyxl
You can install the required libraries with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
---------------------------------
Workflow:

Data Loading:
The dataset HCV_modified.xlsx is read and processed for analysis.
Data Preprocessing:
Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
Encode categorical features (e.g., Sex) with LabelEncoder.
Map target classes to integers for compatibility with models.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train Random Forest and Logistic Regression models using cross-validation.
Measure model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
SMOTE and Feature Selection:
Apply SMOTE to balance imbalanced classes.
Use RFECV for feature selection in Logistic Regression.
Ensemble Modeling:
Blend model predictions using the ABC algorithm for optimal performance.
----------------------------------
